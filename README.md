# GGPOUE

A port of [GGPO](http://ggpo.net) to an Unreal Engine plugin.

## Setup & Usage

Add to the Plugins folder of your Unreal project.

See [doc/README.md](doc/README.md), [doc/DeveloperGuide.md](doc/DeveloperGuide.md), and the [GGPO GitHub](https://github.com/pond3r/ggpo) for more information.

### Sample Application

[VectorWar UE](https://github.com/BwdYeti/VectorWarUE) is a port of the GGPO sample game VectorWar, using GGPOUE for netcode.

### Issues

Currently only usable with Windows, as the GGPO source and network layer depend on Win32 APIs. May be able to reuse some UE functionality for the underlying connection?
